# Checkers
This exercise is a slightly modified version of Exercise 4.14 from Roberts. Create a program to:
Create a background rectangle so it fills the graphics window in the smaller dimension i.e. select the smaller of width and height of the window for the size of the blocks (making the checkerboard square), then center the checkerboard in the larger dimension
Alternate between two colors (e.g. red and black), on an 8 by 8 board. You may choose other colors if you wish, as long as they are different and the checkers show up.
Display checkers in the first three and last three rows in alternating colors, as illustrated in the textbook. Again, you may choose your own colors, as long as the checkers display correctly. Make your checkers centered in their square, and 80% of the square size. It may be helpful to notice the checkers always begin on black squares, in the first three and last three rows of the board.
Note that the Checker Board should resize itself as the windows is resized i.e. the number of rows and columns will stay fixed, but the squares will change size. The board should always be the largest centered square possible in the frame.
